Project Title: RESTful API with Node.js and Express - User Management System

Project Description:

This project is a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js that demonstrates the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user data. The API serves as a user management system that allows external applications to interact with user data by performing various operations like creating a new user, retrieving user information, updating existing user data, and deleting users.

Key Features:

Create: Add a new user to the system by sending a POST request with user details.
Read: Retrieve a list of all users or get a specific user's details using a GET request.
Update: Modify the information of an existing user via a PUT or PATCH request.
Delete: Remove a user from the system using a DELETE request.
Endpoints:

GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users.
GET /users/:id: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
POST /users: Add a new user.
PUT /users/:id: Update a user's information by ID.
DELETE /users/:id: Delete a user by ID.
Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building the server.
Express.js: Web framework for creating RESTful routes and handling requests.
JSON: Format used for data interchange.
